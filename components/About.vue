              In the 2007, I started learning about Usability and User Experience, spending months studying books and articles of Jakob Nielsen, Alan Cooper, Steve Krug, Luke Wroblewski, and others usability guru.
              In the meantime my development and user interface design skills evolved towards a more clean approach, putting the end user at the center of the experience.
              As I matured as full-stack web engineer, in 2016 I started to focus mostly on front-end development.
