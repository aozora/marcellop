         In the 2007, I started learning about Usability and User Experience, spending months studying books and articles of Jakob Nielsen, Alan Cooper, Steve Krug, Luke Wroblewski, and others usability guru.
         In the meantime my development and user interface design skills evolved towards a more clean approach, with always the end user in mind.

         In the 2012 I discovered NodeJs  and I started studying and experimenting with it, and recently I am creating a little CMS as my lab project; this site itself is running with NodeJs & ExpressJs.
         This web site is my attempt to express my self, to state my presence on the web!
